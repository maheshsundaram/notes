# Notes

This repo is to save me a trip to DuckDuckGo, StackOverflow or GitHub. It also has some more polished long form work that was meant for sharing with colleagues, such as:

- [Exhaustive Reducers in Typescript (React)](exhaustive-reducer.md) (October 2020)
- [Approaches to Collaborative Editing](collaborative-editing.md) (August 2020)
- [Mapped Types Medley](mapped-types-medley.md) (May 2020, Updated July 2020)
  - Learn about mapped types in TypeScript, including use with conditionals and infer. Together we'll build a type-safe wrapper around react-router's `generatePath` method.
- [d3 with React + Hooks](d3-react-hooks.md) (August 2020)
